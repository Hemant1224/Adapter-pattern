# Client: The code that uses the Rectangle interface
# Original client code using Rectangle
rect = Rectangle(10, 20)
rect.draw()  # Outputs: Drawing a rectangle of width 10 and height 20

# Using the Adapter to make LegacyRectangle compatible with Rectangle
legacy_rect = LegacyRectangle(0, 0, 10, 20)
adapted_rect = RectangleAdapter(legacy_rect)
adapted_rect.draw()  # Outputs: Drawing a legacy rectangle from (0, 0) with width 10 and height 20




# How It Works:
# Target Interface (Rectangle): Defines the methods the client expects.
# Adaptee (LegacyRectangle): Has a different interface that needs to be adapted.
# Adapter (RectangleAdapter): Implements the target interface and translates the calls to the adapteeâ€™s methods.
# This way, the client can use the LegacyRectangle through the RectangleAdapter without any changes to the original LegacyRectangle or client code, providing a flexible and reusable solution for compatibility issues.
